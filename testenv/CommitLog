	* runTest.py: Improve automation. Read file name from command line and
	use that as a Test Case. Some requirements are marked as TODO in
	comments.
	* HTTPServer.py (initServer): Add support to accept File details that
	will be used by the Server.

	* TestProto: Minor Changes. Most importantly surround HTML syntax in
	CDATA to prevent them from being read as XML Tags. This is required
	since the TestProto file is read as a valid XML Document.
	* IMPORTANT *: The TestProto file must always be maintained as a valid
	XML File, since the parsing engine expects it to be so.

	* runTests.py: Add Responsibilities that this file must handle as a
	comment. No new feature / functionality.

2013-06-05  Darshit Shah  <darnir@gmail.com>

	* HTTPServer.py: Add new classes, StoppableHTTPRequestHandler and
	StoppableHTTPServer that extend the standard classes. These classes
	provide a new method, QUIT which is used to exit the running server.
	* runTests.py (stop_server): Define new function that sends a HTTP
	QUIT Request to the Server to exit it.
	* runTests.py: Spawn the Server in a new process and return control to
	the parent.
	The Server currently runs for only 10 seconds. This will be removed as
	automation to run TestFiles is added later.

2013-06-04  Darshit Shah  <darnir@gmail.com>

	* HTTPServer.py: Convert previous functions to private and create a
	public Caller method. This brings the Server more in-line with it's
	final working.
	* runTests.py: (newfile)
	Currently it simply initializes a new HTTPServer. If multiple servers
	need to be spawned, this may be the right place to do it.

2013-06-04  Darshit Shah  <darnir@gmail.com>

	* TestProto: (newfile)
	A Prototype file that shows how the test cases should be defined.
	Ideally, this file should be copied and edited to write new test
	cases.
	This file will be edited and enchanced as and when required.

2013-06-04  Darshit Shah  <darnir@gmail.com>

	* HTTPServer.py: Comment out Threading Code. We do not need multiple
	servers as yet.
	Edit the server port to a sane vale of 8090.
	Return the correct Content-Length header in a GET Response.
	Make the server serve from the current directory instead.
	Edit the 404 Response message to "Not Found"

2013-06-03  Darshit Shah  <darnir@gmail.com>

	* HTTPServer.py: (newfile)
	Adds a new basic HTTP Server.
	This commit introduces a new HTTP Server that serves on port 1111 and
	2222 through two threads. This will allow atleast two tests to run
	simultaneously.
	The HTTP Server serves local files from the root directory.
	Currently, this Server supports only the HTTP GET Request and returns
	only a 200 OK Status or a 404 Not Found.
	Initial support for POST Requests is being implemented.
	* README: (newfile)
	Adds a README file for basic documentation about the test suite.
	* CommitLog: (newfile)
