	* HTTPServer.py: Convert previous functions to private and create a
	public Caller method. This brings the Server more in-line with it's
	final working.
	* runTests.py: (newfile)
	Currently it simply initializes a new HTTPServer. If multiple servers
	need to be spawned, this may be the right place to do it.

	* TestProto: (newfile)
	A Prototype file that shows how the test cases should be defined.
	Ideally, this file should be copied and edited to write new test
	cases.
	This file will be edited and enchanced as and when required.

	* HTTPServer.py: Comment out Threading Code. We do not need multiple
	servers as yet.
	Edit the server port to a sane vale of 8090.
	Return the correct Content-Length header in a GET Response.
	Make the server serve from the current directory instead.
	Edit the 404 Response message to "Not Found"

	* HTTPServer.py: (newfile)
	Adds a new basic HTTP Server.
	This commit introduces a new HTTP Server that serves on port 1111 and
	2222 through two threads. This will allow atleast two tests to run
	simultaneously.
	The HTTP Server serves local files from the root directory.
	Currently, this Server supports only the HTTP GET Request and returns
	only a 200 OK Status or a 404 Not Found.
	Initial support for POST Requests is being implemented.
	* README: (newfile)
	Adds a README file for basic documentation about the test suite.
	* CommitLog: (newfile)
